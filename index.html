	So on this website I'm going to talk about a few <strong><em>overpowered</em></strong> champs and the first
	one to come to mind is: Yasuo the Unforgiven.
	</p> 
	
	<p>
	Yasuo is a man of resolve, an agile swordsman who wields the wind itself 
	to cut down his foes. This once-proud warrior has been disgraced by a false 
	accusation and forced into a desperate fight for survival.
    With the world turned 
	against him, he will do everything in his power to bring the guilty to justice 
	and restore his honor.</p>
